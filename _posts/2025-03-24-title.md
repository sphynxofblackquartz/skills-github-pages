Something i find really funny in my personal life is how everyone ever calls me gay for whatever reason within a minute of talking to me i keep asking what it is that tips them off and its always the same things: my mannerisms the way i talk the way i walk but thats too vague for me and i just want to know out of sheer curiosity the specifics of how someones gaydar works
